This year I am going to try to do Advent of Code in  [Gleam](https://gleam.run).
To run a day's problems use the command

```sh
gleam run -m day01/solution
```

To run the unit tests for all the days run

```sh
gleam test
```

For some problems, setting the AOC_DEBUG environment variable outputs additional
information.
